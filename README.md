# Tech By Ross
A simple open source tech blog that I will be posting useful resources, tips, news, and more on.

Its all made with HTML/CSS and is live @ techbyross.com. 100 percent functional and the modus operandi has switched from creation mode to maintain mode, so i will be updating the news weekly and my notes/resources sporadically so be sure to tune in ever so often to perhaps learn something new.

As part of this maintain mode im going to be working on the css and such and slowly modernize the blog and attempt to keep it old school but modern in a way where it doesnt look like such shit.
