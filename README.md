# Tech By Ross
A simple open source tech blog that I will be posting useful resources, tips, news, and more on.

Its all made with HTML/CSS and is live @ techbyross.com. 100 percent functional and the modus operandi has switched from creation mode to maintain mode, so i will be updating the news weekly and my notes/resources sporadically so be sure to tune in ever so often to perhaps learn something new.
